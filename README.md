##  About Me  ##
My name is Danielle. I am in my last semester of the master's program here at the University of Florida. My specialization is social media, so I am excited to learn more about web development through this course. I currently live in Gainesville. Some fun facts about me are that I participated in the Disney College Program at WDW in 2019, my sister and I share a pet chinchilla, and I have lived in several states (Alabama, North Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Florida).

## Past Coding Experience ##
Coding is new territory for me, so I am looking forward to learning new skills. I have created websites through Wix before, but I have never learned how to generate my own hmtml. I have some previous awareness of coding by seeing users on Tumblr insert html to create their own theme.


## Career Goals ##
1. Work in a job that pertains to my degree
2. Stay with the same company but advance positions when applicable
3. Build strong network
4. Achieve work-life balance
5. Serve as a mentor/leader one day
